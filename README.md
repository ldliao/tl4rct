# Code to accompanying paper "Transfer Learning With Efficient Estimators to Optimally Leverage Historical Data in Analysis of Randomized Trials"
Simulation code is organized with simulated data, cross validation with tidymodels hand-built version of discrete super learner, estimators used to generate estimates and standard errors, and the combined script of the experiment. Run experiment file loads the scripts individually and runs the full Monte Carlo simulation. The visualization script produces figures in the paper.
